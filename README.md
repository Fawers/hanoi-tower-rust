Hi!

If you have just landed in this repository, I kindly ask you to leave.

This code was written in 2020 when I was but a noob in Rust. So, unless you're
a raccoon 🦝, there's nothing here for you.

If you _do_ want to see a better version of this CLI game, I have just recently
written [this](https://github.com/Fawers/hanoi-tower-rust-v2) in mid February 2022. I think it's much better, since I had
time to actually mature the knowledge I have of Rust's particularities.
